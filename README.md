This is a bad implementation of tournament sort.\
I try to make so I can manually sort things in real life without making too many comparisons.\
As a challenge I didn't use comments to train myself to be able to read code without needing comments.\
\
I came up with the idea of starting this project while I was sorting a deck of cards.\
\
Note: The print statements make this code really slow.\
