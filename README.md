This is a bad implementation of tournament sort.
I try to make so I can manually sort things in real life without making too many comparisons.
As a challenge I didn't use comments to train myself to be able to read code without needing comments.

I came up with the idea of starting this project while I was sorting a deck of cards.
The print statements make this code really slow.
