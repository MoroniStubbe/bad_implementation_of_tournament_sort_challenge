This is a bad implementation of tournament sort.\
I try to make so I can manually sort things in real life without making too many comparisons.\
As a challenge I didn't use comments to train myself to be able to read code without needing comments.\
\
I came up with the idea of starting this project while I was sorting a deck of cards.\
\
Note:The print statements make this code really slow.\
\
Stats of sorting 10,000:\
It takes about 1 minute (print disabled)\
Comparisons: 218,497\
Max comparisons per item: 47
